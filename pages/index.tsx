                Click the button above to experience the magic of semantic
                search inside your very own Notion workspace.
              </h3>
              <h2>How it works:</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  When you click the button, you'll be redirected to Notion to
                  login.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can then choose which pages of your Notion you want to
                  search over.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once we've finished indexing your Notion workspace, we'll send
                  you an email with a unique link to search! Depending on how
                  busy we are, this may take anywhere from a few minutes to a
                  few hours.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Features:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Search over all the content in your Notion workspace.</li>
                <li>Powerful, AI-powered semantic search.</li>
                <li>New content will be fetched and indexed periodically.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>How was this made?</h2>
              <p>
                This website is a thin wrapper atop the{" "}
                <a href="https://operand.ai">Operand</a> API. Specifically, we
                used the{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/operandinc/typescript-sdk">
                  TypeScript SDK
                </a>{" "}
                and have open sourced all of this code on{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/operandinc/searchmynotion">
                  GitHub
                </a>
                . In the near future, we're also going to release a blog post
                detailing the process of building the site, and where we want to
                take it in the future.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>What exactly do you index?</strong>
                  <p>
                    Currently we index text, images, and lists. No tables or
                    other fancy Notion blocks yet, but please let us know if
                    those would be useful for you!
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>I lost my link :(</strong>
                  <p>
                    If you haven't deleted your emails its probably in there,
                    but we can also go find it for you so just reach out on
                    discord or email.
