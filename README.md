## How it works:

1.  When you click the button on [searchmynotion.com](https://searchmynotion.com), you'll be redirected to Notion to login.
2.  You can then choose which pages of your Notion you want to search over.
3.  Once we've finished indexing your Notion workspace, we'll send you an email with a unique link to search! Depending on how busy we are, this may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

## Features:

- Search over all the content in your Notion workspace.
- Powerful, AI-powered semantic search.
- New content will be fetched and indexed periodically.

## How was this made?

This website is a thin wrapper atop the{" "} [Operand](https://operand.ai) API. Specifically, we used the{" "} [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/operandinc/typescript-sdk) {" "} and have open sourced all of this code on{" "} [GitHub](https://github.com/operandinc/searchmynotion). In the near future, we're also going to release a blog post detailing the process of building the site, and where we want to take it in the future.

## Why did we make this?

- We love Notion! We use it every day.
- To showcase our API and provide an example of usage.
- And yes, to start conversations with{" "} [Notion](https://notion.so) itself and similar companies.

## Our promises:

- Your data is yours, and it always will be.
- You can [email us](mailto:support@operand.ai) at any time, and we'll delete your data off our servers.
- Your email inbox won't be spammed.

Operand's [terms](https://operand.ai/terms) and{" "} [privacy policy](https://operand.ai/privacy) apply.
